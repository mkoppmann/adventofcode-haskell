# Advent of Code

My Advent of Code solutions written in Haskell. You can run them by using:

```shell
runghc filename.hs < input.txt
```

I try to use [DocTest](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/DocTest) for the provided test examples. If you have it installed, you can run those tests by using:

```shell
doctest filename.hs
```
